All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project mostly adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - 2019-07-05

### Added
- Added `transform-box` utilities (`transform-border`, `transform-fill`, and `transform-view`)

### Fixed
- Fixed the `transform-style` and `backface-visibility` utility class selectors (thanks, [@slavanossar](https://github.com/slavanossar)!)

## [2.1.0] - 2019-05-26

### Added
- Added support for multi-axis transforms by using an array for the value in the `translate`, `scale`, or `rotate` theme objects

## [2.0.0] - 2019-05-16

### Removed since 2.0.0-beta.1
- Removed the `negativeTranslate`, `negativeScale`, `negativeRotate`, and `negativeSkew` theme objects as they are not needed anymore; just like negative margins in Tailwind 1.0, if the key of a translate, scale, rotate, or skew utility starts with a minus sign (`-`), the generated class will now automatically start with a minus sign as well (e.g. `'-full': '-100%'` in `translate` will generate a `-translate-x-full` class)

### Changed since 2.0.0-beta.1
- Added support for global variants thanks to Tailwind’s `variants()` helper function

### Added since 1.x
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility
- Added a `3d` option (`false` by default) to generate a bunch of new utilities (see `README` for more info)
- Added a `transform` theme object for custom transforms (it’s also what generates the `transform-none` utility)
- Added `perspective` and `perspectiveOrigin` theme objects (for use with the new `3d` option)

### Changed since 1.x
- Most of the config options have been moved to the `theme` and `variants` objects in your Tailwind config (see `README` for more info)
- Transform origin utilities and responsive variants are now generated by default
- Renamed the transform origin classes from `transform-origin-[key]` to `transform-[key]`

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-04-07

### Added
- Tailwind 1.0.0 compatibility
- Added a `3d` option (`false` by default) to generate a bunch of new utilities (see `README` for more info)
- Added a `transform` theme object for custom transforms (it’s also what generates the `transform-none` utility)
- Added a `negativeScale` theme object (useful for flipping an element horizontally and/or vertically)
- Added `perspective` and `perspectiveOrigin` theme objects (for use with the new `3d` option)

### Changed
- Most of the config options have been moved to the `theme` and `variants` objects in your Tailwind config (see `README` for more info)
- Transform origin utilities and responsive variants are now generated by default

## [1.0.2] - 2018-11-04

### Added

## [1.0.1] - 2018-08-14

### Added

### Changed
- Merged `translateX` and `translateY` options into a single `translate` option
- Merged `negativeTranslateX` and `negativeTranslateY` options into a single `negativeTranslate` option

### Fixed
- Fixed escaping in selectors generated by the plugin
